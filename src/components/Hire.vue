      <h3>Why should Google hire Gabrielle Geroudet ?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="resultText">
      <p>
        By hiring me, I would contribute with what I can do to help people access information.
        I would help Google in developing new tools, reinforce the products and services already created to help Google
        achieve their vision and goals.<br>
        Thanks to my skills in accessibility in web development, I would help developing their products and services in
        making them more accessible for everyone (disabled and non-disabled people).<br>
        As I have skills in UI and UX Design, I understand better the problematic of creating a product with a nice
        design but with each element designed to help people access information faster.<br>
        Finally, Google has no secret for me and after one week working for Google, it would be as if I was there for
        years.
